Additionally, charities may allow companies to neglect ethical considerations in their supply chains, such as worker exploitation and environmental harm, while masking these issues with charitable branding. Finally, charity can serve as a temporary solution that fails to address systemic injustices, leading to a cycle of reliance rather than empowerment.\n"
